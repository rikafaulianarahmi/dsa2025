Your requirement
- Analyze the code for each method (sequential and binary)
- Explain every feature syntax there

For Sequential:
- It will generate 100 random number 
- After that, user need to input what number to be searched
- The system must 
- - count how many that number in the array
- - point which index they are (0-based index) and for each count

For Binary:
- The user will define how many number (size) the array
- The system tell whether found or not, if found, point the index (0-based index)


For comparing
- Start from the how are they works
- Big-O for time and space complexity
- Their initial requirement
- Best usage


Want to add more feature? yes you can, as long the requirement above already exceeded. But explain it CLEARLY in your report!
